# Bert-Sentiment

## Overview
This project leverages the power of BERT's deep contextual understanding to analyze the sentiment of Amazon reviews with high accuracy. The model processes review text and outputs numerical sentiment scores, enabling quantitative analysis of customer satisfaction and product reception.

## Features

- BERT-powered Analysis: Utilizes pre-trained BERT models for state-of-the-art sentiment classification
- Sentiment Scoring: Generates numerical sentiment scores for quantitative analysis
- Amazon Review Processing: Specifically designed to handle the structure and language patterns of Amazon reviews
- Scalable Processing: Efficiently processes large datasets of reviews

How It Works
The sentiment analysis pipeline processes Amazon reviews through several stages:

- Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares review text for BERT input
- BERT Encoding: Converts text into contextual embeddings using BERT's transformer architecture
- Sentiment Classification: Processes embeddings through trained classification layers
- Score Generation: Outputs numerical sentiment scores representing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment

## Requirements
torch
transformers
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

## Usage
# Basic usage example
from sentiment_analyzer import ReviewSentimentAnalyzer

analyzer = ReviewSentimentAnalyzer()
reviews = ["This product exceeded my expectations!", "Poor quality, would not recommend"]
scores = analyzer.analyze_sentiment(reviews)
print(scores)

## Output Format
The model outputs sentiment scores typically ranging from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive), with scores near 0 indicating neutral sentiment.

## Applications

- Product performance monitoring
- Customer feedback analysis
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Quality assurance and improvement insights
- Automated review summarization

## Model Performance
The BERT-based approach provides superior contextual understanding compared to traditional sentiment analysis methods, effectively handling:

- Sarcasm and nuanced language
- Product-specific terminology
- Complex sentence structures
- Context-dependent sentiment
