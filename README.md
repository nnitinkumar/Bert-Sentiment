# Bert-Sentiment

## Overview
This project leverages the power of BERT's deep contextual understanding to analyze the sentiment of Amazon reviews with high accuracy. The model processes review text and outputs numerical sentiment scores, enabling quantitative analysis of customer satisfaction and product reception.

## Features

BERT-powered Analysis: Utilizes pre-trained BERT models for state-of-the-art sentiment classification
Sentiment Scoring: Generates numerical sentiment scores for quantitative analysis
Amazon Review Processing: Specifically designed to handle the structure and language patterns of Amazon reviews
Scalable Processing: Efficiently processes large datasets of reviews

How It Works
The sentiment analysis pipeline processes Amazon reviews through several stages:

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares review text for BERT input
BERT Encoding: Converts text into contextual embeddings using BERT's transformer architecture
Sentiment Classification: Processes embeddings through trained classification layers
Score Generation: Outputs numerical sentiment scores representing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment
